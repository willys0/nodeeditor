Plans
=======================================================================

1. Model-view approach.
A specific graph representation is wrapped in a model that delivers the
information to the framework. The graph could be stored as a set of
pointers, table etc.
2. Headless mode. Graph Model works on its own without GUI rendering.
3. Optional data propagation (data flow). 
4. QML frontend.


Graph Model
=======================================================================

Graph Model references all the nodes and their interconnections.
Nodes have input and output ports. We model directed graph.

Graph Visualization
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

A simple Graph Model could be visualized.
It does not support any data types or data transferring.
We simply show nodes and connections and enable simple editing:
- Moving nodes around,
- Dis- and Re-connecting nodes,


`FlowGraphicsScene` stores the maps:
- `map<Node, NodeGraphicsObject>`,
- `map<pair<Node1, Node2>, Connection>`

each NodeGraphicsObject gets all the relevant information from the
`GraphModel` (node position, colors etc).

```
class FlowGraphicsScene : public QGraphicsScene
{
public:
  explicit NodeGraphicsScene(GraphModel * graphModel) {}

  ...

};
```


```cpp

class GraphModel
{
public:

  std::vector<Node> const &
  allNodes() const = 0;

  unsigned int
  nPorts(Node const & node, PortType portType) const = 0;

  std::vector<Node>
  connections(Node const & node, PortType portType) const = 0;

  QVariant
  data(Node const & node, NodeRole role);

  void
  setData(Node const, NodeRole role);
};


enum class NodeRole
{
  Data     = 0,
  DataType = 1,
  ConnectionPolicy = 2,

  Position = 3,
  CaptionVisible = 4,
  Caption = 5,


}:

```
